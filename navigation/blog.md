**This blog is a collection of my explorations in programming and computer science. Here there are insights from my experiences with various coding concepts, including data structures, booleans, and more. This new knowledge has been obtained through assignments, projects, and collaborative efforts.**

**I aim to share not just the technical aspects of coding but also the collaborative spirit of learning with my peers. This may be through group presentations, self-study reflections, or unique coding examples.**

(*Feel free to browse through my blog, where youâ€™ll find detailed breakdowns of programming topics, practical applications, and personal growth reflections.*)

<span style="color:#4682B4; font-size: 20px;"><b>Topic 3.10</b></span>
<br>
My group presented on Topic 3.10, covering how to edit, alter, and create lists in Python and JavaScript. We demonstrated list manipulation techniques and showcased practical examples in both languages.

<span style="color:#4682B4; font-size: 20px;"><b>Topic 3.2 Breakdown</b></span>
<br>
- Integers: Whole numbers used in various calculations.
- Floating-Point Numbers: Represent real numbers with fractional components, allowing for more precise calculations.
- Strings: Sequences of characters that represent text, crucial for data manipulation and user interaction.

<span style="color:#4682B4; font-size: 20px;"><b>Topic 3.5 Breakdown</b></span>
<br>
- Boolean Values: Booleans can only be true or false, representing logical conditions.
- Boolean Expressions: These expressions evaluate to either true or false and often involve relational operators such as equal to, greater than, and less than.
- Logical Operators: Booleans can be combined using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to create complex conditions that dictate program flow.
- Relational Operators: These operators help compare values and determine their relationships, forming the basis for conditional statements in programming.
