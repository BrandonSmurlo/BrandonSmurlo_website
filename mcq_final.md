<h1>MelodyMates Project Feature</h1>

<h2 style="color: #a3c4f3; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(163, 196, 243, 0.6); font-size: 1.5em;">
    Music Preference Survey
</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> The program receives structured user-generated data through an interactive interface, allowing users to enter values such as their favorite artist and genre.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> The system implements persistent data storage using a structured data abstraction, such as a database or data table, to retain user preferences across sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Modification:</strong> Users can update or delete stored data dynamically, demonstrating procedural abstraction through functions that modify database entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Accessibility:</strong> The program displays stored user preferences using data visualization techniques, allowing other users to retrieve and explore different music tastes.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> The application ensures persistent data management by maintaining user information even after execution ends, using a cloud-based or local storage solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The user interacts with the user interface (UI) by navigating to the Music Preference Survey section on the MelodyMates website.</li>
    <li>Through input validation, the system accepts structured user input, including favorite artist, genre, and other musical preferences.</li>
    <li>Upon submission, the program executes a procedure to store the data in a relational database, making use of tables.</li>
    <li>Users can later call predefined functions to modify or remove existing data entries dynamically.</li>
    <li>Other users retrieve stored data through database queries to view and analyze the music preferences of different users.</li>
</ol>

        Helping Each Other Get Final Exam Ready
    </h2>

    <p class="exam-intro" style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Arush Shah and I have been working together to prepare for the final exam by reviewing each other's websites and giving feedback. We did a <b>mock presentation</b> to ensure we are both ready.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

        CPT Requirement Highlights/Application
    </h2>
    
    <p class="analysis" style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        My profile-building feature in MelodyMates allows users to input their music preferences, which are dynamically stored in a database. This feature incorporates several key computing principles required in the CPT project.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 15px; justify-content: center;">
        
        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #e3f2fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #0d47a1;">1. User Input</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                Users enter their favorite artists, which are stored and used to personalize their profiles. Additionally, trending artist data is retrieved from an external data source to enhance recommendations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #fff3e0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #e65100;">2. List/Collection</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                The system uses multiple lists: <strong>user_preferences</strong> stores the user’s selected artists, <strong>trending_artists</strong> tracks popular music data, and <strong>recommendations</strong> generates suggested artists based on similarities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #1b5e20;">3. Procedure Definition</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                A function called <strong>generate_recommendations</strong> takes the user's preferences as a parameter and processes the data to return a list of suggested artists based on trending music and stored user preferences.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #fce4ec; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #880e4f;">4. Algorithm Implementation</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                The recommendation algorithm follows key programming constructs:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sequencing:</strong> Data is initialized, retrieved, and processed in order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Conditional statements check for matching genres or similar artists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Loops process each artist in the lists to generate recommendations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #ede7f6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4527a0;">5. Procedure Call</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                The <strong>generate_recommendations</strong> function is called whenever a user submits new preferences or modifies existing ones. It updates dynamically with trending artist data to ensure relevant suggestions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #ffebee; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
            <h3 style="color: #b71c1c;">6. Output</h3>
            <p class="analysis">
                The final recommendations are displayed visually on the frontend, allowing users to see and interact with their personalized music suggestions.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="analysis" style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 1.1em; text-align: center;">
        By integrating these CPT requirements, my feature effectively processes user data, maintains structured lists, applies algorithmic logic, and delivers a dynamic, interactive experience.
