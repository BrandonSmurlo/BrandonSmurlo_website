    Music Preference Survey
</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> The program receives structured user-generated data through an interactive interface, allowing users to enter values such as their favorite artist and genre.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> The system implements persistent data storage using a structured data abstraction, such as a database or data table, to retain user preferences across sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Modification:</strong> Users can update or delete stored data dynamically, demonstrating procedural abstraction through functions that modify database entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Accessibility:</strong> The program displays stored user preferences using data visualization techniques, allowing other users to retrieve and explore different music tastes.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> The application ensures persistent data management by maintaining user information even after execution ends, using a cloud-based or local storage solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The user interacts with the user interface (UI) by navigating to the Music Preference Survey section on the MelodyMates website.</li>
    <li>Through input validation, the system accepts structured user input, including favorite artist, genre, and other musical preferences.</li>
    <li>Upon submission, the program executes a procedure to store the data in a relational database, making use of tables.</li>
    <li>Users can later call predefined functions to modify or remove existing data entries dynamically.</li>
    <li>Other users retrieve stored data through database queries to view and analyze the music preferences of different users.</li>
</ol>
