    "# Panel Response Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Central Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Powershell script to determine if old soldiers had their data in systems\n",
    "- Got rid of old data so that nobody can find and use the old data for malicious reasons\n",
    "- Employee on leave of absence had their access shut down because they had stolen from the company and interacted with competetors\n",
    "- Cyber security allowed this threat to be stopped, and legal actions were taken\n",
    "- Biggest cybersecurity threats: Ransomware --> can kill companies, costs people many billions of dollars\n",
    "- Ransomware can steal ideas that people invested a lot in\n",
    "- AI contributes to ransonware and more advanced cyber attack weapons\n",
    "- Fishing: Users who don't know security basics click on links, hackers can access classified data\n",
    "- Zero Day = Vulnerability that has no patch for it, **everyone** is vulnerable --> ex. malware can apply to all updates from a cloud \n",
    "- Use real world threat examples to help prepare for actual cyber threats\n",
    "- Backdoor = Unconventional way into a software system (can help hackers get in) --> Leads to ethical concerns\n",
    "- Penetration testers are used in order to ensure security of systems\n",
    "- Software is a career that was not prominent a few decades ago, but has now evolved into a crutial topic in the modern world\n",
    "- Getting a background in I.T helps with a cyber security career path\n",
    "- Soft skills very essential to a software career (or any career in general) --> Curious, passionate, likable\n",
    "- Learn how networks communicate, internships to learn the field in the real world\n",
    "- From a business standpoint, cyber security is important to investors not to obtain more money, but to prevent themselves from losing money\n",
    "- Cyber security is great in itself, but the people behind it are just as important\n",
    "- Trend for next 5-10 years: Reduction of human error through specialization (ex. medical field), AI, prioritization of cyber security\n",
    "- Networking is extremely important with a career in software\n",
    "- Computer scientists must adapt their competency because cyber security is a constantly updating and changing field\n",
    "- Could use TACP server to experiment with cyber security for my website\n",
    "- Could also use CTF environments for cyber security \n",
    "- CC certification would be a good certification that is free and allows for learning\n",
    "- Most technical exploits and cyber attacks are never actually implemented\n",
    "- Cyber attacks can spread extremely quickly, and even faster for legal cyber processes --> \"Patch Tuesday, exploit Wednesday\"\n",
    "- Meeting and speaking with diverse groups of people can help to keep updated on software advances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving, requiring constant learning and adaptation  \n",
    "- Real-world case studies help reinforce awareness and preparedness  \n",
    "- Both technical and soft skills are essential in the cybersecurity field  \n",
    "- AI is both a tool and a threat in modern cyber defense and attacks  \n",
    "- Investing in cybersecurity is crucial for protecting company value and reputation  \n",
    "- Networking, internships, and certifications are key stepping stones into the field "
