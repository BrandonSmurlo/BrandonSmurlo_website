    "The digital divide is the gap between those with access to modern technology and those without. Efforts to bridge this gap include public Wi-Fi programs, tech donations, digital literacy training, and community tech hubs. To further reduce the divide, we can expand broadband infrastructure, create mobile tech classrooms, establish mentorship programs, develop affordable tech solutions, and encourage partnerships between schools and businesses. By improving access to technology and education, we can ensure more people have the digital skills needed to succeed in today’s world."
