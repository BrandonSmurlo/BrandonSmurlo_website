    "Represent individual users, accounts, or entities in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges (Links):\n",
    "Represent relationships or interactions between users. These can be:\n",

    "Directed (e.g., A follows B on Twitter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Undirected (e.g., A and B are friends on Facebook)\n",
